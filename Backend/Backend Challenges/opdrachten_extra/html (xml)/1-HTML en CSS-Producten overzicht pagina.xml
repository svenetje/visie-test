For this assignment, you will be creating a product overview page using HTML and CSS. The page should contain a template for a product, which includes product details such as name, description, and price. You should use the GRID design pattern with FLEX where necessary to create a clean and organized layout.

Here are the steps you can follow to complete this assignment:

1. Create a new HTML file and give it a descriptive name such as "product-overview.html".
2. Inside the &lt;body&gt; tag, create a &lt;div&gt; to contain the product template. Give it a class name such as "product-template".
3. Within the "product-template" &lt;div&gt;, create &lt;div&gt;s for each piece of product information, such as name, description, and price. Give each &lt;div&gt; a class name such as "product-name", "product-description", and "product-price".
4. Use CSS to style the "product-template" &lt;div&gt; and its child &lt;div&gt;s using the GRID design pattern. Use FLEX where necessary to create a clean and organized layout. 
5. Use CSS to style the individual product information &lt;div&gt;s, such as font size, color, and alignment.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each product you want to display on the page.
7. Save your HTML and CSS files and open the HTML file in a web browser to test that the product overview page displays correctly.
