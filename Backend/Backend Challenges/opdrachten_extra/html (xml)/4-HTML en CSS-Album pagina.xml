<Assignment xmlns="http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/Syn_OpenAI_AppLib.Data" xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><AssignmentText>For this assignment, you are required to create a template for a photo and video album page using the FLEX and/or GRID design patterns in HTML and CSS programming language. The album page should have a modern and visually appealing design, with clear and concise sections for photos and videos.

Here are the steps you can follow to complete this assignment:

1. Plan the layout of the album page. Decide how many photos and videos you want to include and how you want to display them. You can use FLEX and/or GRID to create a responsive layout that adjusts according to the size of the screen.

2. Create the HTML structure of the album page. Use semantic tags such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; to organize the content. Use CSS classes and IDs to style the different sections of the page.

3. Add CSS styling to the HTML structure. Use FLEX and/or GRID design patterns to create a modern and visually appealing design. Use CSS properties such as font-size, font-family, color, background-color, padding, margin, border, and box-shadow to style the different elements of the page.

4. Add photos and videos to the page. Use HTML &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags to include the media files. Use CSS styling to adjust the size and position of the media files.

5. Test the page on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that it is responsive and displays correctly.
